So for data...
I'm thinking that some form of structure. JSON? gson can flip classes into json and back, which can
account for persistence layer...
can be passed in, and the .capml can have a decorator for keys in particular. (Maybe a = symbol?)
Maybe a built in function for easy data transformation in and out?
Or possibly have a container for updating the information inside the parser class!!
So an inner class which can contain either json or an object, then once the data is punched it,
it can be pulled out of the parser class! Blam
